# lta-transit-data

The Land Transport Authority of Singapore publishes transportation data periodically. This project helps users download many types of public transit data from the LTA DataMall. 

The data types include: 
- Monthly average transit passenger volume data for bus and train, including node and od data, divided into hours in a day.
- Bus service, stop, and route data.
- Train station point data.

After registering an account key on the LTA website, users can start downloading data with the Jupyter Notebook, LTA_data.ipynb.
